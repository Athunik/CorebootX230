  ECP 1.12 (G2HT33WW)

```
### ...then send 'em my way.
#### Lenovo is updating their BIOS often, but their ECP says the same for most of the time. I would love to have all of them in this repository.
#### Make sure you include dump from SPI1 and SPI2 both.
#### You can send 'em to my inbox on reddit.
